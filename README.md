A few things. 

- I am no longer Eric, I no longer identify with him.
I leave his historic projects here for their value and history both
in themselves and as a reflection of who Eric was.

- I have moved to gitlab in order to no longer support github. You
may find me and my continuing efforts at [My Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/ericalina).

- This github account is no longer actively used. I leave it here as 
a stake in time which still has valueable resources and history.
A few of these projects continue on at the above gitlab link.

<hr/>

Hello, I'm Erica, 
my being and place in the world is very different from what
Eric's was. I consequently see differently and am a different person.

<pre>
I write as if he is passed, 
because he has, 
he can no longer be, 
except as my experience, a memory,

if I am to be.

I could not be him.
</pre>

You can find me in the present at [My Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/ericalina).

He wrote this, I changed the tense.

Have a beautiful day
Erica


Eric worked in many domains using many languages over the decades. He designed and built
many systems, most of which were/are proprietary. He loved creating beautiful code.
His strongest languages were C, python, clojure, elisp and Unix tools. He did a lot of object oriented work in
C derived languages and python. He wrote a few languages and frameworks. He created 
a few publishing systems, using troff, LaTeX and many other markup languages.
His favorite language was clojure and functional
programming which he was likely to do in any language.

He was an Arch linux, Xmonad user/programmer for many years and he wrote
a lot of Emacs lisp. 
<hr/>

#### Clojure

Eric wrote a lot of proprietary clojure code. Some his libraries for data processing with Hadoop
and cascalog are available here publicly.

#### Natural Languages
He was very interested in learning natural languages. He developed his
own pedagogy in order to learn french, and continued with Roumanian, Italian and Spanish.
He's done some plugins for Anki in the past. He was a writer, so his 
emacs was setup with a variety of tools to enable that, input methods, 
language-tool, dictionaries, synonyms, etc.  His QMK keyboard firmware also 
supports multiple languages.  It is, however, out of date at this point.
Go find Erica on gitlab.

#### His old book - ODS Markup: Tagsets by Example.

If you are a user of SAS ODS and Tagsets, you may be interested in the
book he wrote many years ago on his Tagset language. It was slated to be
published by SAS Press but never was. So he gives it here for free.
Installing LateX and compiling it to pdf is a to do.

**[ODS Markup: Tagsets by Example](https://github.com/EricGebhart/Tagsets-by-example)**

#### Code tests
You might notice he has a few code tests, some of these have come from interview processess.
He didn't believe in code tests as an adequate method of ascertaining abilities.

### Some Favorite projects.

Aside from the very mundane setup and configuration repos,
Eric's favorite projects over all others are _SPR_, _Plysp_,
_Word-Search_, _Bike-Gear-Calculator_, and *QMK_firmware*/_MyQMK_.
My _QMK_, _Xmonad_ and _Emacs_ setups are always getting tweaks.
He always used _scad-clj_ for 3D work.

His _dfs-clj/DFS datastore library_ does make it very easy to create
immutable, partitioned/sliced no sql databases with hadoop, which can be
quite fun to play with. Ironically,  it seems that Cascalog integrates with
Clojure much more nicely than Datomic´s datalog which is verbose
and ugly. It needs an update but dfs-clj has worked
admirably with a variety of big data sources over extended periods.
