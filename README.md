I´ve been programming a very long time now. More than 40 years. 
A great amount of the code I have written is proprietary and not viewable.
I have written many tools, debuggers, and development tools, etc.
I have designed and built databases, frameworks and the large complex systems 
that need them. At SAS I was responsible for many 100´s of 1000´s of lines of code.
My strongest skills are Architecture and systems design. I´m good at the big picture.
I´ve done all sorts of databases, object oriented programming, functional programming.
I´ve taught programming in various languages including my own.
The last decade I have been programming in functional languages like Clojure
which I love, and Haskell, mostly for my Xmonad configuration.
Recently I wrote the SPR language on top of python as an answer to a problem
I was solving. The end result is a quite nice functional language, which leverages
python libraries directly and simply.
I´ve written a fair amount of lisp, and lisp languages which I find fascinating
to create. I´ve been an Arch linux, Xmonad user for many years and I´ve written
a lot of emacs lisp. Emacs is the best vi emulator anywhere.

### The projects that might be interesting here, are 
 * [MyQMK](https://github.com/EricGebhart/MyQMK/tree/Main/users/ericgebhart) - It uses macros extensively and is unlike any other user space in QMK.
 * [Arch linux packages](https://github.com/EricGebhart/arch-pkgs/) - This uses make extensively, and contains some utilities. 
 * [Arch linux install](https://github.com/EricGebhart/Arch-Setup/)** My Arch linux installation script. 
 * Arch linux install - A nice script that automates Arch installs.
- **[SPR - Simple Process Repl](https://github.com/EricGebhart/simple-process-repl) - A very cool language at this point. [SPR Wiki](https://github.com/EricGebhart/Simple_Process_REPL/wiki)
- **[Plysp](https://github.com/EricGebhart/plysp)** A simple lisp after clojure. [incomplete] - SPR has been too fun.
- **[My Xmonad](https://github.com/EricGebhart/xmonad-setup/)** My Xmonad window manager. 
 * Xmonad - Haskell, It doesn´t change much these days.
- **[My Emacs Setup](https://github.com/EricGebhart/emacs-setup/) - It´s home grown, so shows my way of organizing emacs.

- **[Pail-Schema-Example](https://github.com/EricGebhart/Schema-Example/) - This is an example project that shows how to use pails and schema with hadoop and cascalog. This is using dfs-clj before dfs-clj came about.
- **[SAS-Papers](https://github.com/EricGebhart/SAS-Papers) - My papers which will show my writing and give some insight into SAS ODS for which I was a significant contributor.
  * [Word search](https://github.com/EricGebhart/word-search/) - Something I wrote from my own motivations. A meta data collector for words. I have plans for it.
  * [bike gear calc](https://github.com/EricGebhart/bike-gear-calc/) - I wanted a nice one, and I wanted to learn clojure/spec.
  * [flickr-fetcher](https://github.com/EricGebhart/flickr-fetcher) - A code test, turned into a design test. It won a job for me and solved their troubles.
